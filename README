Instructions:

Setup:

In Google App Engine dashboard: Register an application
Download this repo: git clone git://github.com/smashcubed/idovoices.git
in app.yaml: change "application: idovoices" to your own application name
Deploy the application

In Twilio's dashboard: point a number to http://<yourapplicationname>.appengine.com/sms
You're ready to play!


Play:
Send "play" to the number you assigned (we'll call it HOST).  You will receive a name to impersonate.
Without saying the name of the person, get others to text the name to HOST. (They can misspell a little)
When someone is correct, they get 10 points, you get 20 points and a new name to impersonate.
Everyone gets a name at the same time.
First to 200 points wins!
If you accidentally say your name or don't know who that is, text "pass" for a new name.
